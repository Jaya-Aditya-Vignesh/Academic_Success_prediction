# Academic_risk_of_Students
The primary aim is to develop a predictive model that accurately assesses the likelihood of academic risk for students in higher education. This involves identifying students who are at risk of experiencing academic challenges that could potentially lead to dropout or underachievement.
This model will effectively distinguish between students who are likely to succeed academically and those who may encounter difficulties. By leveraging various predictors such as academic performance metrics, socio-economic background, demographic information, and possibly behavioral patterns, the model aims to provide insights into potential risk factors.
By accurately predicting academic risk, the model facilitates early intervention strategies by educational institutions. This proactive approach can help educators and administrators implement targeted support programs and interventions to improve student outcomes, enhance retention rates, and foster overall academic success among students in higher education institutions.
